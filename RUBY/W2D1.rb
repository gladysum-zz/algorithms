# Muni Routes
# ----------------------------------------
# You are at a busy intersection and need to get to brunch ASAP. There
# are multiple Muni buses that go by, but you don't know which to take.
# Given a hash of routes (with route number as the key and next stop on the
# route as the value) return the number of the first route in the hash that
# could get you to your brunch spot. If none exist, return nil.
