# Vowel Censor
# ----------------------------------------
# Write the function vowel_censor that takes in a string and replaces
# any vowels in it with an "X". Do not modify the original string.

# With regex
def vowel_censor(string)
  string.gsub(/[aeiouAEIOU]/, 'X')
end

# Without regex
def vowel_censor(string)
  vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
  new_string = ""
  string.each_char do |c|
    if vowels.include?(c)
      new_string << "X"
    else
      new_string << c
    end
  end
  new_string
end

#   * NOTE: you do not need to know regex to make it through jumpstart, but it is a nice tool!
#   * What does the #each_char method do?
#   * What is the name of this operator '<<' and what string method does it perform?
