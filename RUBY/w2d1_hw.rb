# Number Counting Sequence
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The number counting sequence is a sequence of number strings that begins with:
# ["1", "11", "21", "1211", "111221", ...]
#
# "1" is counted as "one 1" or "11", followed by
# "11" which is counted as "two 1s" or "21", followed by
# "21" which is counted as "one 2 and one 1" or "1211", and so on.
#
# It helps to "say it out loud" to describe the item in the sequence.
#
# Given an integer n, generate the n-th element in the number counting sequence.
